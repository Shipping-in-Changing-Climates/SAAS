# SHIP IMPACT MODEL VERSION 4
# Author: John Calleya (UCL)
# Version: 1.0
# History:
# Version 1.0 does not fully work but links functions functions from different
# universities

# Description:
# The main structure of the model is contained in main.py, which is called by
# the user interface contained in inputdata.py

# use numpy package for maths (instead of math or cmath package) with np
import numpy as np

# switches and variables that are not currently in user interface
# NOTE THAT SOME OF THESE ARE NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING YET!!!

##        GZ or Righting Moment as function of heel angle
##        Ship speed demand
##        Ship heading demand
##        Wind Speed relative to ship
##        Wind Direction relative to ship
##        availabe deck area for sizing
##        
##        OUTPUTS
##        Weight
##        Cost
##        Additional Thrust provided by sail
##        Added Resistance due to sail (e.g. equivalent due to rudder corrections and heel)
##        
##        This needs to be run to find the design phase of the sail.  We need to
##        do this for real time voyage and for "average wind conditions".  For
##        average wind conditions the inner loop can be precalculated to save time.
##        
##        In the design phase it is necessary to specify how sail is used and this
##        call of the wind function can also be used to precalculate variables.
