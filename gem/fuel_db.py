    Fuels examined are those listted in the "Evaluation Studies Report
    Document" Tech. data is predominantly found in
    "SCC Theme 3 Goal and Scope" document

    N.B. in the Evaluations Studies document, fuels are listed such as
    "Bio HFO" and "Bio MDO". In the literatre ("SCC Theme 3 Goal and Scope",
    and others) There is no distinguishment between the two. There is
    Straight Vegetable Oil (SVO) and Bio-Diesel,
    which is made by processing SVO.

    Bio-Methanol LCV is from "The Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable
    Transportation Fuels" http://www.f3centre.se/fact-sheet/methanol

    Fossil Fuel
    ===========
    Index   Type                   LCV (MJ/kg)
    1       HFO                    40.435
    2       MDO                    42.7
    3       LNG                    45.0
    4       Methanol               19.93
    5       Hydrogen               120.0

    Bio-Derived Fuel
    ================
    Index   Type                   LCV (MJ/kg)
    6       SVO (Soya bean)        39.62
    7       SVO (Rapeseed)         36.5 (average)
    8       Bio-Diesel (Soya bean) 39.75
    9       Bio-Diesel (Rapeseed)  37.0
    10      Bio-LNG                ???
    11      Bio-Methanol           19.8
    12      Bio-Hydrogen           ???


dictionary is of the form key: [Name, LCV, CO2 Emission Factor]

The units of CO2 Emission Factor are tonnes of CO2 per tonne of fuel
