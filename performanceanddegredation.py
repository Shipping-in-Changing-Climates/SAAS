# Description:
# This file contains the engine degredation model/fouling model and added
# resistance model developed by Strathclyde University

# Assumptions:
# The added resistance can be represented as an additional resistance or as a
# speed loss - for a speed loss it is assumed that the power demand is
# calculated by using the demanded speed + speed loss.
# Does not use strip theory

# use numpy package for maths (instead of math or cmath package) with np
